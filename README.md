A real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO that enables instant communication between multiple users. The application maintains a persistent WebSocket connection, allowing messages to be sent and received in real time without requiring page refreshes.

The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and responsive user interface, while the backend handles client connections, message broadcasting, and real-time data exchange. This project demonstrates the implementation of real-time web communication, client–server architecture, and frontend–backend integration.
